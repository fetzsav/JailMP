JailMP is a simple multiplayer jailer mod for the game Project Zomboid. This mod was coded in Typescript using [PipeWrench](https://github.com/asledgehammer/PipeWrench/wiki). The Typescript files can be found in the *src/* folder, and **the transpiled Lua files can be found in the *dist/* folder**


Functionality is chat-based, and would typically be used as an admin command. In the current version, only Admins can use the *jail* commands.

To use, send a chat message as follows

```
!jail [username]
```
```
!unjail [username]
```


Single player version coming soon with GUI clickable self-jail button.
